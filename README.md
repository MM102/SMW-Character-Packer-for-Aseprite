# SMW-Character-Packer-for-Aseprite
A script and character template to help develope and export SMW characters directly within Aseprite.

# Installation

To use this script you must have Aseprite installed.

To install the script follow these steps:
1.) In Aseprite, navigate to 'File > Scripts > Open Scripts Folder'
2.) Copy the 'SMW_Character_Packer' folder to your scripts folder
3.) In Aseprite, navigate to 'File > Scripts > Rescan Scripts Folder'

To use the script go to
'File > Scripts > SMW_Character_Packer > SMW_Character_Packer'
Alternatively, you can set a hotkey for this in your keyboard shortcuts.

For ease of use, I recommend checking
'Give full trust to this script' when it tries to access files.

# Included

* A blank creation sheet
* My character testing rom
* An aseprite script to pack everything automatically

To see how the script and sheet work I recomend watching the tutorial videos below.
It will go over some of the intricacies and subtlies of making a smw character that are easy to miss too.
